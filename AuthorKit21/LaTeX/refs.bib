abstract = {Two code files and one dataset related to Olympic Twitter activity are the foundation for this article. Through Twitter's Spritzer streaming API (Application Programming Interface), we collected over 430 million tweets from May 12th, 2016 to September 12th, 2016 windowing the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and Paralympics. We cleaned and filtered these tweets to contain Olympic-related content. We then analyzed the raw data of 21,218,652 tweets including location data, language, and tweet content to distill the sentiment and emotions of Twitter users pertaining to the Olympic Games Kassens-Noor E. etÂ al., 2019. We generalized the original data set to comply with the Twitter's Terms of Service and Developer agreement, 2018. We present the modified dataset and accompanying code files in this article to suggest using both for further analysis on sentiment and emotions related to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and for comparative research on imagery and perceptions of other Olympic Games.}

abstract = {Mega-event boosters frequently claim increased public attention and improved host city imagery as a rationale for public investments in major events. We design a methodology and develop an algorithm to measure both, public attention and imagery. We apply the algorithm to capture over 430 million tweets and content-analyze over 21 million tweets related to the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee, and their host cities. Olympic-related attention captures ~12.5% of the global twitter discourse during the event. In the English language, Olympic cities receive a positive brand value from the Olympic Games, because positive tweets about the Games and their prior, future, and bid cities exceed negative tweets at a ratio of 4:1. The Olympics leave no long-term image-legacy on twitter to their hosts but attract significant positive attention to the future host city. In contrast, the IOC attracts more negative than positive attention on twitter.}
